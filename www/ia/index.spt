This is Gittip's information architecture, where we define what pages we have
on the site, and the purpose of each page. This document looks at Gittip from
the outside, from the point of view of the user's experience. The [System
Architecture](/sa/), on the other hand, discusses the architecture of the
system by which we deliver this experience.

Gittip basically has six kinds of pages:

  1. [Homepage](/ia/homepage)
  1. [Profile](/ia/profile)&mdash;A representation of an individual Gittip
    participant.
  1. [Community](/ia/community)&mdash;A page aggregating many participants
    together.
  1. [Account Elsewhere](/ia/accounts-elsewhere)&mdash;A representation of an
    account on a different social network or platform.
  1. [About](/ia/about)&mdash;Documentation about Gittip.
  1. [External](/ia/external)&mdash;Widgets, embeds, buttons, browser
    extensions, etc. Off-site experiences that none-the-less are part of our
    information architecture.

The first experience most users have of Gittip is a widget or button or other
kind of mention or link on someone else's website. We don't have analytics
right now on button reach due to technical issues, but rule of thumb we have
10x the off-site impressions that we have on-site.

The first on-site experience most users (65%) have is a [profile
page](/ia/profile), with a significant minority (24%) starting out on
the [homepage](/ia/homepage).  [Community](/ia/community) pages and [accounts
elsewhere](/ia/account-elsewhere) get a lot less traffic.
