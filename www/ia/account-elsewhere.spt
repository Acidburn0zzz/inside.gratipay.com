[---] text/html via markdown

An "account elsewhere" page is a representation of an account on another social
network or platform besides Gittip. The purpose of these pages is two-fold:

  1. To allow existing Gittip users to pledge tips to people who haven't joined
     Gittip yet.

  1. To make it easy for users on other platforms to see how and why to join
     Gittip.

Some platforms have "group" or "team" concepts and we try to model those as
well.
