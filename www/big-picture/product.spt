Gratipay's [mission](./mission) is to enable an economy of gratitude,
generosity, and love. Our [values](./brand/) additionally include honesty,
kindness, directness, and optimism. Our [audience](./audience/), the potential
partners in our mission, is two-fold: people who want to tip their friends, and
people who want to run an open company. What product are we building to deliver
on this mission with this audience?


## Overview

Gratipay, the product, is a tool, the primary purpose of which is to enable
[our users](./audience/) to delight their friends and run their companies. The
secondary purpose is to enable our users' users to receive tips, make payments,
and collect payroll. The tertiary purpose, for the subset of users who share
our mission (we [think of them](./welcome) as owners), is to aid them in
steadily amplifying a virtuous cycle between gratitude and
generosity&mdash;"inspiring generosity"&mdash;until an entire economy comes to
flourish on this reciprocity.

Our product is a social payments platform. A user creates an account,
configures a payment, and connects a funding instrument. We process payments
every Thursday.


## Information Architecture

We have four top-level components to our information architecture:

 1. [Gratipay.com](https://gratipay.com/)&mdash;our main website
 1. [API](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/#api)&mdash;endpoints integrated within gratipay.com
 1. [grtp.co](http://grtp.co/)&mdash;widget server
 1. [Gratipay-Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gratipay-everywhere/ffbkkncpfcobpjaolefljnpmianmflig?hl=en)&mdash;browser extension


### Gratipay.com

This is our main website and receives the most attention. Here's its structure:

  (  restricted to authenticated user
  [  restricted to admin
  $  variable

```

Here are our cross-cutting concerns:

 - overall visual language
 - layout
 - navigation
 - tables/listings
 - form controls
 - global call-to-action (to fund Gratipay itself)


### API

Our [public API](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/#api) is comprised of
ad-hoc JSON endpoints integrated within Gratipay.com.


### grtp.co

Our [widget server](http://grtp.co/) serves a JavaScript client for our API and
a library for embedding HTML components into a third-party website.


### Gratipay-Everywhere

The point of this is to add Gratipay buttons to third-party websites such as
GitHub and Twitter. Currently only implemented for Chrome.
