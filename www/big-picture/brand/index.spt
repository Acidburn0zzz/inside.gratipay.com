The important thing about a brand is to keep it in check, to make sure it
serves people and doesn't run amok. Running amok means caring more about
numbers than about [our mission](/big-picture), or caring more about our
mission than about people. "We just didn't sell enough Barbie dolls." That's a
[brand run
        amok](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/business/media/barbies-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue-causes-a-stir-online.html).

## Brand Values

Genuine **love of critique** is how to keep a brand in check, and that's our
first brand value. I don't believe in haters and I don't believe in trolls. I
retweet negative feedback, because that person is telling us some kind of
truth, and I want to hear it and I want others to hear it. I want Gittip to
[culture-jam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_jamming) itself. See
[Resentment](https://medium.com/building-gittip/2c621dbd7541) for an example.

Gittip has been called "**sweetly idealistic**" (Elizabeth Weiss, [The New
    Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2014/02/can-we-crowdfund-a-creative-middle-class.html))
and it's been accused of "**unabashed optimism**" (@traverseda, [on
GitHub](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/1659#issuecomment-28245596)).
        Yes.

Gittip has also been called "**radically awkward and kind of fucking weird**"
(Sam Biddle,
        [Valleywag](http://valleywag.gawker.com/startup-guy-will-only-talk-if-he-can-share-the-conversa-494280374)).
Yes.

We also value **openness and transparency** and everything else in <a
href="/big-picture">our mission</a>:

> Gittip's mission is to redeem the economy.
>
> We envision a future in which the economy is characterized by trust,
> collaboration, cooperation, sharing, openness, transparency, care for one
> another, inclusion, inspiration, purpose, generosity, patience, empathy,
> optimism, and love.

## Heart Coins

The Gittip logo is called the "heart coin," and I have a [penny
        puncher](http://dribbble.com/shots/1388610-Gittip-Logo/attachments/200640)
that makes real-life heart coins out of pennies. I had it [made
        originally](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/436) for
PyCon 2013. It was a hit! Then my nephews ruined the tooling but I had it
[resharpened](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/821).

## Pronunciation

When I started Gittip, I pronounced it like two words, "get tip" or "git tip."
I believe it was [Michel Floyd](https://twitter.com/MichelFloyd) whom I first
heard pronounce it as one word, "giddip." I decided to adopt that
pronounciation because it distances Gittip from its early roots as merely a
"tipjar for GitHub," and helps to establish Gittip as a brand in its own right.
I started using the new pronunciation in earnest at PyCon 2013. PyCon 2014 is a
month away as I write, and I've long since adjusted to the new pronunciation.
:-)

Herewith, a video pronunciation guide featuring [the old logo, and] the voice
of [Nick Quaranto](https://twitter.com/qrush). Thanks, Michel and Nick!  :-)

## Publishing

Here are the main channels (besides our main site) that we use to communicate
as a brand, as Gittip:

  - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Gittip)
  - [Tumblr](http://blog.gittip.com/)
  - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gittip/229465400522758)
  - [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+gittip/posts)

We generally don't speak as Gittip very often. Instead, I prefer to listen to
conversations on each platform, and weigh in as an individual, using my
personal accounts. You can, too! :-)
