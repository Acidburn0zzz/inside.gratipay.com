The important thing about a brand is to keep it in check, to make sure it
serves people and doesn't run amok. Running amok means caring more about
numbers than about [our mission](/big-picture/mission), or caring more about
our mission than about people. "We just didn't sell enough Barbie dolls."
That's a [brand run
amok](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/business/media/barbies-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue-causes-a-stir-online.html).

## Brand Values

Genuine **love of critique** is how to keep a brand in check, and that's our
first brand value. I don't believe in haters and I don't believe in trolls. I
retweet negative feedback, because that person is telling us some kind of
truth, and I want to hear it and I want others to hear it. I want Gratipay to
[culture-jam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_jamming) itself. See
[Resentment](https://medium.com/inside-gratipay/2c621dbd7541) for an example.

Gratipay has been called "**sweetly idealistic**" (Elizabeth Weiss, [The New
    Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2014/02/can-we-crowdfund-a-creative-middle-class.html))
and it's been accused of "**unabashed optimism**" (@traverseda, [on
GitHub](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/1659#issuecomment-28245596)).
        Yes.

Gratipay has also been called "**radically awkward and kind of fucking weird**"
(Sam Biddle,
        [Valleywag](http://valleywag.gawker.com/startup-guy-will-only-talk-if-he-can-share-the-conversa-494280374)).
Yes.

We also value **openness and transparency** and everything else in <a
href="/big-picture">our mission</a>:

> Gratipay's mission is to redeem the economy.
>
> We envision a future in which the economy is characterized by trust,
> collaboration, cooperation, sharing, openness, transparency, care for one
> another, inclusion, inspiration, purpose, generosity, patience, empathy,
> optimism, and love.

## Heart Coins

The Gratipay logo is called the "heart coin," and I have a [penny
        puncher](http://dribbble.com/shots/1388610-Gratipay-Logo/attachments/200640)
that makes real-life heart coins out of pennies. I had it [made
        originally](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/436) for
PyCon 2013. It was a hit! Then my nephews ruined the tooling but I had it
[resharpened](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/821).

## Pronunciation

Gratipay is pronounced like gratitude.


## Publishing

Here are the main channels (besides our main site) that we use to communicate
as a brand, as Gratipay:

  - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Gratipay)
  - [Tumblr](http://blog.gratipay.com/)
  - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gratipay/229465400522758)
  - [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+gratipay/posts)

We generally don't speak as Gratipay very often. Instead, I prefer to listen to
conversations on each platform, and weigh in as an individual, using my
personal accounts. You can, too! :-)
