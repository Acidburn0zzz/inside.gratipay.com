This document explains our use of GitHub issue labels. Click on a label below
to go to a listing of related issues.

Every ticket should have exactly one of the following:

  - The stars are for user experience-related issues, high, medium, and low priority:<br>
    - <a href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues?labels=%E2%98%85%E2%98%85%E2%98%85">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</a>
    - <a href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues?labels=%E2%98%85%E2%98%85%E2%98%86">&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</a>
    - <a href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues?labels=%E2%98%85%E2%98%86%E2%98%86">&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues?labels=TeamX %E2%98%85">TeamX
    &#9733;</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues?labels=TeamX">TeamX</a> are for high-
    and low-priority "team experience" issues.

Once a PR is ready for review, apply the <a 
href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues?labels=Review">Review</a>
label to it.
