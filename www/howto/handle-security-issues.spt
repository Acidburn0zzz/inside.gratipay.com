Security issues may be responsibly disclosed to
[chad@zetaweb.com](mailto:chad@zetaweb.com). See
[security.txt](https://gratipay.com/about/security) for more information, 
including my PGP key and our Hall of Fame.

When we receive a security disclosure, create a private repo in GitHub to track
the issue, using the naming convention `security-deadbeef`. Add any relevant 
security researchers and Gratipay staff to the repo.

If the issue requires code changes, here's how to make them privately:

```
repo=security-xxxxxx
branch=fix-participant-inequality
git remote add $repo "git@github.com:gratipay/$repo.git"
git push $repo master:upstream
# â†‘ This takes a while, gratipay's history is pretty big and full of tarballs
git push -u $repo $branch:$branch
```

And here's how to deploy them before merging back to upstream:

```
git checkout master && git pull
git merge $branch
make test  # can't be too careful, right?
./release.sh
```

Once the issue is resolved and any fix is deployed, make the repo public. Here
are the repos we've opened up so far:

 - https://github.com/gratipay/security-00004
