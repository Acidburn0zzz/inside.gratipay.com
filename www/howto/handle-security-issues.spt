Security issues may be responsibly disclosed to
[chad@zetaweb.com](mailto:chad@zetaweb.com). See
[security.txt](https://gratipay.com/security.txt) for acknowledgements and PGP key.

When we receive a security disclosure, we create a private repo in GitHub to
track the issue. We can add the security researcher to the repo and any
relevant Gratipay staff. Once the issue is resolved, we make the repo public.
