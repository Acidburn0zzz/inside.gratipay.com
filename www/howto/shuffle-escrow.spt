We hold escrow in two accounts:

 1. **New Alliance (payins)**&mdash;Money enters our escrow via credit card
    charges on Braintree, which settle to an account at [New Alliance Federal
Credit Union](http://newalliancefcu.com/) in
[Ambridge](https://medium.com/gratipay-blog/meet-ambridge-8b9b2b6f8628).

 1. **PayPal (payouts)**&mdash;We keep a standing balance in PayPal, because it
    takes 3-5 days to add funds, and we need to be able to run MassPay
immediately after payins on Thursdays.

After [running MassPay](run-masspay), "Add money" to PayPal from New Alliance,
whatever is needed to bring our PayPal balance up to 5x this week's MassPay.
The 5x number is based on historical spikes in new withdrawals, though we're
going to have to significantly revise our escrow shuffling system as we
[minimize our escrow](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/1383).
