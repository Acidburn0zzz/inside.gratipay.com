We're flying under PayPal's radar right now. It's unlikely that we'll be able
to use them at scale (because we're a marketplace and they won't want to
        underwrite us; see
        [#63](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/63#issuecomment-14676114)),
            so we're doing this quasi-manually and not first-class.

1. Collect username, PayPal email, and API eight on support@gittip.com.
1. [Run](/policies/run-a-script) `invoke set_paypal_email`.
